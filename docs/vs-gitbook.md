[GitBook](https://gitbook.com) is a knowledge management tool that helps you create documentation sites.

## Open source

Hyperdocs is open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/lalit2005/github). But GitBook is a paid service with a free plan.

## Content management

In GitBook, you can edit and create and manage your content from the dashboard.

But when using Hyperdocs, you can edit and create and manage your content from GitHub repo directly.

Hence you can use all the amazing collaboration features of GitHub while using Hyperdocs.
