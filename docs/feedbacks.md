Feedbacks play a vital role in crafting a delightful documentation.

That is why Hyperdocs has a built in fully fledged feedback system. Every site comes with a feedback collecting widget that helps you gather feedback from your users.

Feedbacks also come with a rating that's measured in terms of stars out of five.

## Notification

Whenever someone submits a feedback, if you would like to be notified via email, you can set up the _Web3forms API key_ in the site dashboard.

[Here's](/hyperdocs/docs/why-web3forms) why [I](https://twitter.com/lalitcodes) went with the [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com) for the email stuff.

## View all feedbacks

You can view all the feedbacks collected till date for a site in the Hyperdocs dashboard.
