Feedbacks play a vital role in creating a delightful documentation.

That is why Hyperdocs has a built in feedback system. Every site has a feedback collecting widget that helps you gather feedback from your users.

Feedbacks also come with a rating that's measured in terms of stars out of five.

## Notification

Whenever someone submits a feedback, if you would like to be notified, you can set up the _Web3forms API key_ in the site dashboard.
