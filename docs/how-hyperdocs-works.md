Hyperdocs basically just fetches the content from GitHub, adds styles, replaces jsx strings with React components and generates website

After setting up Hyperdocs for the first time, you can just start adding markdown files in the `/docs` directory and Hyperdocs will automatically update the website.

You can use `npx hyperdocs-cli new <filename>` to create a new markdown file in the `/docs` directory. It also updates the `_sidebar.txt` file with the new file.

Hyperdocs uses Next.js to render the website. The website keeps updating periodically with the help of Next.js <Tooltip content="Incremental Static Regeneration">ISR</Tooltip> feature. So you don't need to worry about the rebuilding stuff.

To render mdx, Hyperdocs uses the [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) from Kent C. Dodds.

The periodic regeneration regenerates very quickly because `mdx-bundler` uses esbuild under the hood to bundle mdx.
