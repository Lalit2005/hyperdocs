Sections in sidebar let's you categorize different pages in your documentation site.

You can have different categories for your docs such as `INTRODUCTION`, `API`, `GUIDES`, `SCREENCASTS`, `FAQ`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SUPPORT`, etc..

The documentation that you are looking at also has different pages categorized into `INTRO`, `VS OTHERS`, `FEATURES` and `USAGE` in the sidebar.

Adding a category heading is very easy in Hyperdocs. Simply add a new new file that starts with `- ` (that's a hyphen followed by a space) and then the category name. For example, `- INTRO`.

<Accordion title={'Here\'s the `_sidebar.txt` file for Hyperdocs with categories:'}>
